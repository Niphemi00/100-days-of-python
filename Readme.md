## Python and Go-lang 100-Day Challenge

Welcome to my Python and Go-lang 100-Day 100-Day Challenge repository! This journey is all about developing consistent programming habits, building projects, and deepening my understanding of Python. Each day, I'll tackle a new challenge to improve my skills and document my progress.

## Objectives

Consistency: Dedicate time daily to practice Python.

Skill Development: Improve my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of Python's core concepts and libraries.

Projects: Create real-world projects to apply my learning.

Documentation: Track my progress and share my learning journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day having its own folder:

Python-and-goLANG-100-Day-Challenge/
  python/
    Day01/
      main.py
      notes.md
    Day02/
      main.py
      notes.md
  go Lang/
    Day01/
      main.go
      notes.md
    Day02/
      main.go
      notes.md
  ...

## Folder Contents

main.py and main.go: The solution to the day's challenge.

notes.md: Reflections, concepts learned, or challenges faced during the day.

## Tools and Technologies

Python Version: 3.12.3
go version: 1.23.4

Editor: [VS Code / PyCharm / etc.] or user choice of editiors

Libraries: I will explore core Python libraries and third-party libraries as needed.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and follow along:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Niphemi00/100-days-of-python.git

Navigate to the desired day's folder.

Run the Python scripts using python challenge.py.

## Challenges Overview

Days 1-14: Basics and Core Concepts (syntax, loops, functions, data structures).

Days 15-31: Intermediate Topics (file handling, OOP, error handling).

Days 32-58: Intermediate+ Python and go Libraries and web foundation tutorial and Projects.

Days 59-81: Advanced Topics (web scraping, APIs, databases).

Days 82-100: Projects

Days 101: Conclusion and Summarization

## Goals

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

Master Python and go fundamentals and advanced topics.

Build a portfolio of Python and go projects.

Prepare for real-world programming challenges.
