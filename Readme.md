## Python 100-Day Challenge

Welcome to my Python 100-Day Challenge repository! This journey is all about developing consistent programming habits, building projects, and deepening my understanding of Python. Each day, I'll tackle a new challenge to improve my skills and document my progress.

## Objectives

Consistency: Dedicate time daily to practice Python.

Skill Development: Improve my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of Python's core concepts and libraries.

Projects: Create real-world projects to apply my learning.

Documentation: Track my progress and share my learning journey.

## Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day having its own folder:

Python-100-Day-Challenge/
  Day01/
    challenge.py
    notes.md
  Day02/
    challenge.py
    notes.md
  ...

## Folder Contents

main.py: The solution to the day's challenge.

notes.md: Reflections, concepts learned, or challenges faced during the day.

## Tools and Technologies

Python Version: 3.12.3

Editor: [VS Code / PyCharm / etc.] or user choice of editiors

Libraries: I will explore core Python libraries and third-party libraries as needed.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository and follow along:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Niphemi00/100-days-of-python.git

Navigate to the desired day's folder.

Run the Python scripts using python challenge.py.
