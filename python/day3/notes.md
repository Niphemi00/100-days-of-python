# Day 3: Control Flow and Operators in Python and Go

## Python Notes

### Key Topics Covered

#### 1. **Control Flow**
- **if, elif, else Statements**:
  - Syntax:
    ```python
    if condition1:
        # code block
    elif condition2:
        # code block
    else:
        # code block
    ```
  - Example:
    ```python
    age = 18
    if age < 18:
        print("You are a minor.")
    elif age == 18:
        print("You just became an adult!")
    else:
        print("You are an adult.")
    ```

#### 2. **Operators**
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Membership Operators**: `in`, `not in`
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 10
  y = 20
  if x < y and y > 15:
      print("Both conditions are true.")
  ```

### Challenges Faced
- Nested `if` statements can become confusing; using `elif` helps reduce complexity.

### Practice Questions
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program to check if a given word exists in a sentence.
